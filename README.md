# 3rd Party Install Scripts
This repository stores install scripts for 3rd party libraries. This contains scripts that are configured for easy building of libraries or scripts for downloading pre-built binaries. These are useful for trying to use libraries in Windows without having to directly store dlls for every library dependency in the repository itself. Instead a script is added which is used to download the dependency. This is only needed for Windows as other OS's such as Linux have package managers to handle these sorts of the dependency issues. 

## Libraries
Listed here are each of the libraries that have build/download scripts. 
### OpenCV

### Boost

### Python

### I3DRSGM

### Phobos Integration
